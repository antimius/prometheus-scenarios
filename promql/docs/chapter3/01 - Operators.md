# Operators
**Objective:** learn how to use operators.

Prometheus allows the use of operators for addition(+), subtraction(-), multiplication(\*), division(/), modulo(%) 
and exponentiation(^). These operators can act between two scalars where it yields the resulting in a new scalar value. 
However, when you use these operators between an instant-vector and a scalar the result will be a new instant vector 
and the operation will be performed on each individual value. 
Lastly , when applying an operation between two instant vectors you are combining time series. 
This will result is an instant vector containing a value for the left-hand side where a matching label of 
the right hand side has been found. Left-hand side entries without matching right-hand side entries are not in the result.

See the following example:
  * example1{label="test"} = 0.7
  * example1{label="test2"} = 1.3
  * example2{label="test"} = 0.4

The result of example1 + example2 would be:
  * {label="test"} = 1.1

Note that the example1 with the label test2 is ignored because the instant vectors did not have match in example2.
